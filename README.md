## Laravel Inverter
Laravel inverter is a website system used to monitor the output sensor from single phase inverter that has been made of arduino nano. The sensor used in this system is the PZEM-004t sensor. Output sensors monitored are voltage, current, power, energy, frequency, and power factor. This project is my thesis project, while studying in the Department of Electrical Engineering, Universitas Sebelas Maret, Indonesia.
